On the planet, an ancient prophecy has begun to manifest. The natural balance that has sustained life in this world is in danger, and a group of brave heroes must embark on an epic adventure to save their home.

### Functionality ‚öîÔ∏è:
This is a game that will be developed within a story context created by me. Each character has unique abilities. What they need to do is solve puzzles and at the same time, they can attack. This game will remain active as long as the player performs the correct activities to continue the combat and not die or correctly guess the puzzle.

### Limitations:
To have a better interaction with my code, I'll give you some tricks you should keep in mind when playing the game.
- Read the instructions provided by the program carefully, as you will need to enter a number in the game and then enter a word to guess the puzzle (spoiler alert - if you get it right, you will finish the combat).
- The program does not include a visual interface.
- If you select an option that is not integrated into the code, it will ask you for that option again (in some cases).
- Do not enter any string with capital letters or spaces before and after the string.

### Considerations üõ∏:
The program only runs in the console and is made with C++, so to run the program, a compiler is needed. To compile the program, follow these steps:
1. Download the files.
2. Save them in the same folder.
3. Open the terminal in the folder's directory.
   Recommendation for users:
   To navigate between folders, use cd + the folder name. To see the directory of each folder, use dir (for Windows) and ls (for Linux/Mac OS).
4. In your terminal, type g++ main.cpp -o main (for Windows).
5. In your terminal, type .\main (for Windows).
6. Have fun playing the game!

- In some parts, if the user enters a term not established in the program, the game will ask the user for the correct input until it receives one that it is familiar with.

## Interest üõ∞Ô∏è:
This project emerged among several ideas; however, it was the one I chose to develop because I believe it has the complexity for me to learn all the topics in detail and at the same time review many topics I have seen throughout this year. It also stems from my love of creating stories, and although making a role-playing game is new to me, I will enjoy it to the fullest.

### UML Diagram üèÅ:

### Corrections:
## Progress 1:
- The class diagram was created to visualize how I was going to implement my video game. This way, I had to come up with an idea of how I could make my video game a reality and also consider the limitations it would have. Although this is my first time making a video game, I feel I will enjoy it a lot.

Progress comments:
The idea of implementing OOP to make a video game is correct and very interesting. The cases that would cause the project to stop working are well explained, and the UML diagram is correct and well explained. Enjoy the implementation!

## Progress 2:
- For this delivery, I had to implement inheritance, access modifiers, overloading, and overriding.

Progress comments:
Well-implemented inheritance, correct use of access modifiers, overloading, and overriding. The output of your code is quite confusing, and there are some syntax errors, for example, /n is displayed in the terminal; the correct usage is \n.

## Progress 3:
- During this progress, I implemented polymorphism for my video game's methods. This allowed me to better implement the simulate combat method in my Planeta class.

Progress comments:
Well-implemented polymorphism.

## Progress 4:
- For this delivery, I made some significant modifications to the code of my classes; however, the idea was taking shape, and I had a better idea of how to make my mini video game.
- Added/removed attributes.
- Documented the code.
- Updated the UML diagram.
